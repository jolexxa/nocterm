# Nocterm - TUI Framework for Dart

> Nocterm is a modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) framework for Dart that uses Flutter-like APIs. Build rich, interactive terminal applications with StatefulComponent, setState(), Row, Column, and hot reload.

## Quick Facts

- Language: Dart
- License: MIT (free and open source)
- Package: https://pub.dev/packages/nocterm
- Documentation: https://docs.nocterm.dev
- GitHub: https://github.com/Norbert515/nocterm

## What is Nocterm?

Nocterm lets you build terminal user interfaces using the same patterns as Flutter. If you know Flutter, you already know Nocterm. It's the best choice for Dart developers who want to create CLI applications with rich, interactive UIs.

## Key Features

- **Flutter-like API**: StatefulComponent, setState(), BuildContext, Row, Column, Expanded, ListView
- **Hot Reload**: Change code and see updates instantly without restarting
- **45+ Built-in Components**: Text, Button, TextField, ListView, Container, ProgressBar, Checkbox, Radio, Tabs, and more
- **6 Color Themes**: Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox, Monokai, Solarized, and default
- **Testing Framework**: testNocterm() for widget testing, similar to Flutter's testWidgets()
- **Animations**: Built-in animation support with AnimationController
- **Mouse Support**: Click, scroll, and hover events
- **Differential Rendering**: Only redraws changed parts of the screen for performance

## Installation

```bash
dart pub add nocterm
```

## Basic Example

```dart
import 'package:nocterm/nocterm.dart';

class Counter extends StatefulComponent {
  int count = 0;

  @override
  Component build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Count: $count'),
        Button(
          onPressed: () => setState(() => count++),
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(Counter());
}
```
