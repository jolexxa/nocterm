/// ```dart
/// final textColor = AdaptiveColor(

///   dark: Color.fromRGB(248, 248, 242),  // light text for dark backgrounds
/// );
///
/// // Resolve based on current theme
/// final resolvedColor = textColor.resolve(theme.brightness);
/// ```

  /// The color to use in light theme.

  /// The color to use in dark theme.

  /// Creates an adaptive color with different values for light and dark themes.

  /// Use this when a color should remain the same regardless of theme,
  /// such as brand colors or specific accent colors.
